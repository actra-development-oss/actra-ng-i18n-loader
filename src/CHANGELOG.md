## Version 1.0.0 - BREAKING
- Switched to a custom structural directive to get rid of of required "localeBinding" option
- Implemented module, directive and service to provide a convenient way of switching locale and getting rid of the locale property on every component

This release is incompatible with previous versions as the way the loader works has drastically changed.
